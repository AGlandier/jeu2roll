# Jeu2roll - An RPG managing webapp

## The project

### Details
  Jeu2roll is a web application developped to train the skills I learned during my formation. It's an rpg managing app in French language
based on Dungeons&Dragons 5th rules. It contains standard web application features (Login/logout, edit profile etc.) and more specific stuff,
such as character creation (following the official rules of the game).

### Technologies
- Back-end (RestAPI) : Java Spring
- Database : MySQL
- Front-end : Angular framework
- Design : Bootstrap 5

## Install and run the project
  Since the project works only locally, there's a few manipulation to do before running it.
  
  1. You need [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) installed before starting with the app
  2. Set up the database : create a local MySQL database (with XAMPP for example) and execute this request : `CREATE DATABASE appjdr;`
  3. Open "jeu2roll_back" folder as a new java app in your IDE and run it (as Java app OR Springboot app)
  4. With an API manager (such as Insomnia) complete the database with the jsons in data folder (Post requests : refers to API documentation TODO)
  5. Open "jeu2roll_front" with a command prompt and run this command : `ng serve` (it will work unless you don't have Angular correctly installed, in this case, go back to step 1)
  6. Open the app in the browser of your choice ! (http://localhost:4200/)

## Improvements expected
  This project is a WIP, the following feature may be added in the future :
  - Post creation for admin users âœ…
  
  - Friendship and groups creation
  - Sorting the lists (News, characters ...)
  - Language selection
  - Scenarii and maps imports
  - Dynamic dice roller
  - JS alignment selector for character creation
  - Room creation to view maps/dicerolls while playing
